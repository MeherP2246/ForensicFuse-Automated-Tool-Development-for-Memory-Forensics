# Tool Name: ForensicFusion
## Automated VM creation and Docker, Volatility Management Tool
The Automated Memory Analysis Tool project is designed with the dual objective of democratizing the process of memory analysis for beginners and enhancing the efficiency of forensic investigations for experienced professionals. At its core, the project aims to simplify the intricate processes involved in digital forensics, such as the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) and the detailed analysis of memory dumps, by integrating a user-friendly graphical interface with the powerful capabilities of the Volatility framework. Targeting a broad audience, from novices seeking practical experience in digital forensics to seasoned experts looking to streamline their workflows, the tool serves as both an educational platform and a professional utility. By automating complex procedures and offering step-by-step guidance, the project not only makes advanced forensic techniques accessible to those with little to no prior experience but also contributes to the efficiency and productivity of forensic investigations across the board. Ultimately, the scope of this project extends beyond merely facilitating forensic analysis; it aims to foster a deeper understanding of digital forensics within the community, thereby enhancing the collective capability to address and mitigate cybersecurity threats.


# Features

### 1. Virtual Machine Creation: 
The tool provides an easy-to-use interface for creating virtual machines on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android platforms. Users can select the desired operating system and version, and the tool will guide them through the process of setting up the virtual machine.

### 2. Sample Malware Scripts: 
The tool provides access to sample scripts that can be executed within the virtual machine to observe their impact on the system. Users can then use Volatility to analyze the effects of these scripts on the virtual machine.

### 3. Memory Dump Analysis: 
After creating the virtual machine, users can take a memory dump of the system and analyze it using the Volatility tool. The tool provides a cheatsheet with Volatility commands for various analysis tasks, such as retrieving process information, network information, registry data, and more.

### 4. Docker Integration: 
The tool seamlessly integrates with Docker, enabling users to effortlessly fetch and utilize the Volatility Docker image for memory dump analysis. It supports both automated and manual Docker installation processes, alongside providing comprehensive guidance for users to create their Docker setups.

### 5. Linux profile creation
This tool enables users to generate a Linux profile for analysis with Volatility.
