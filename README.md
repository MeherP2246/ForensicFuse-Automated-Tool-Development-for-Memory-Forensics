# Tool Name : ForensicFusion
## Automated VM creation and memory analysis tool


The Automated Memory Analysis Tool project is designed with the dual objective of democratizing the process of memory analysis for beginners and enhancing the efficiency of forensic investigations for experienced professionals. At its core, the project aims to simplify the intricate processes involved in digital forensics, such as the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) and the detailed analysis of memory dumps, by integrating a user-friendly graphical interface with the powerful capabilities of the Volatility framework. Targeting a broad audience, from novices seeking practical experience in digital forensics to seasoned experts looking to streamline their workflows, the tool serves as both an educational platform and a professional utility. By automating complex procedures and offering step-by-step guidance, the project not only makes advanced forensic techniques accessible to those with little to no prior experience but also contributes to the efficiency and productivity of forensic investigations across the board. Ultimately, the scope of this project extends beyond merely facilitating forensic analysis; it aims to foster a deeper understanding of digital forensics within the community, thereby enhancing the collective capability to address and mitigate cybersecurity threats.
